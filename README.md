# N_body_simulation

* Main: contains the Pygame main loop. The simulation to be used can be selected at the bottom.
* Particle: contains the particle classes.
* Simulations: new simulations can easily be added here.
* Color: some constants and functions to help with colors and gradients.
* Ticker: controls the iterations of the Pygame main loop.

# Usage

* Run the main.py file
* Left mouse pans the screen
* Right mouse (hold) creates new particles in the direction indicated by the line. Longer hold increases the particles' mass.
